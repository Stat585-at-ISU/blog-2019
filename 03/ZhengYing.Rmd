1. **Pick one of the papers Retraction Watch features on their website and describe what went wrong**. 


I read the post "Food packaging journal to retract paper by researchers in Thailand".
The problem is "self-plagiarism": The paper is retracted because it is a duplicate publication, which has been previously published in another journal.


2. **After reading the paper by Sandve et al. describe which rule you are most likely to follow and why, and which rule you find the hardest to follow and will likely not follow in your future projects.**






I will follow the rule 6: Record the initial random seeds. Since the same seeds will generate the same following random numbers and make the simulation project reproducible. I will also follow rule 7. When I need to re-plot or adjust figures, I will revise the code and use the raw data to produce new figures. 



Rule 5 is hard to follow since the data in my research is in huge size and we do not have enough disk space to store them. 

The hardest rule to follow is rule 2. Since the real-word data are not always in good structure and may have different format and contain errors. It is more efficient to combine both scripts and manual editing to adjust the format.
