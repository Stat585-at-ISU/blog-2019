Write a blog post addressing the questions: 

1. **Pick one of the papers Retraction Watch features on their website and describe what went wrong**. 
I read one retracted paper named "After university goes silent, diabetes journal retracts three papers". The researchers using the same imagins to represent different experimental conditions.  


2. **After reading the paper by Sandve et al. describe which rule you are most likely to follow and why, and which rule you find the hardest to follow and will likely not follow in your future projects.**
Rule 1 is the rule I am most likely to follow. In data analysis, each step of the data processing there are some underlying assumptions or principles that been involved to get the processed or summarized data. To draw the solid conclusion from the final result, we need to keep tracking about all the assumptions and principles to make sure they are no conflict among them. 
Rule 4 and 5 are also important to make the data processing more efficient and easier for tracking and revising future self and other people who may need to work on these data.
