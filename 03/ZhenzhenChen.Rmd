Write a blog post addressing the questions: 

1. **Pick one of the papers Retraction Watch features on their website and describe what went wrong**. 

The article I have read that is "Food packaging journal to retract paper by researchers in Thailand". In this paper, it indicated another kind of plagiarism, "self-plagiarism". The Thai researchers tried to use their old publication to republish. Most people may not have a deep understanding of this concept, but it is a wrong thing to do. 

2. **After reading the paper by Sandve et al. describe which rule you are most likely to follow and why, and which rule you find the hardest to follow and will likely not follow in your future projects.**

Rule 7 is the most likely to follow, since it is convenience to for us to modify the coding for the plot, and also help us to get visual figures. 

Rule 4 is hardest to follow since it is hard to track every detailed change for the computer program. Even if we detect the piece of changing, it may take people to use lots of time to learn and use to it.
