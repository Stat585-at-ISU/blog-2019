Write a blog post addressing the questions: 

1. **Pick one of the papers Retraction Watch features on their website and describe what went wrong**.

    [The IR1152 mutant insulin receptor selectively impairs insulin action in skeletal muscle but not in liver](http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/content/68/2/464.1). It has several image duplication, which appear to be identical images.  
    - Lane 2 appears to be a duplicate of lanes 3, 5, and 6, with horizontal rotation.
    - Lane 4 appears to be a duplicate of lane 7.
    - Lane 11 appears to be a duplicate of lane 12.
    
2. **After reading the paper by Sandve et al. describe which rule you are most likely to follow and why, and which rule you find the hardest to follow and will likely not follow in your future projects.**

    Most likely to follow Rule 1. I will check every step to make them correct after I write or execute it. Rule 4 is hard to follow, since remembering the idea behind different versions is hard. Rule 2 is also hard, because sometimes data is not stored in correct or tidy form, then loading it without modifying the file could mess it up.
