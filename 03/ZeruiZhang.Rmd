1. **Pick one of the papers Retraction Watch features on their website and describe what went wrong**. 

    I choose to talk about [Governance and taxes: evidence from regression discontinuity](https://aaajournals.org/doi/10.2308/accr-51520). According to the abstract, the authors implemented a regression discontinuity design to examine the effect of institutional ownership on tax avoidance. They misstated the use of one index membership in the main specifications, and conducted a robustness test based on an inapproriate data. This academic misconduct was discovered by a follow-up researcher saying that the authors still kept the same numbers in their paper after changing the specifications.


2. **After reading the paper by Sandve et al. describe which rule you are most likely to follow and why, and which rule you find the hardest to follow and will likely not follow in your future projects.**

    Rule 5. Record All Intermediate Results, When Possible in Standardized Formats is the one I will definitely follow. It would not only provide proof for the results but become a good habit to make research more organized and traceable.
    
    Rule 2: Avoid Manual Data Manipulation Steps is a little hard to follow completely since copying and pasting some numbers from different files is quite unavoidable, especially for one single number or result.
