1. **Pick one of the papers Retraction Watch features on their website and describe what went wrong**. 
In the article "Biochemist in Spain retracts eight papers at once", the article was withdrawn because of the questions on Fig.4,A and B. The original data behind Fig 4,B could not be found because this experiment was performed 13 years ago, thus the authors state a new experiment was performed.
2. **After reading the paper by Sandve et al. describe which rule you are most likely to follow and why, and which rule you find the hardest to follow and will likely not follow in your future projects.**
I am most likely to follow rule 5 (record all intermediate results) because I made mistakes before. When I was working on propensity score matching, I only recorded the matching result without the original data with their scores. Then I got issues with my matched data and I had no way to fix it because I could see what went wrong. Now, I record every dataset and result when I generate them.
I think the hardest rule to follow is rule 4. Sometimes, I write some scripts only for exploring, and they are nor well orgnized. It is hard to control all of them. I usually rewrite the useful scripts into a formal way and control thoes formal scripts.
