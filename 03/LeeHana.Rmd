1. **Pick one of the papers Retraction Watch features on their website and describe what went wrong**. 

The title catching my eyse was "Biochemist in Spain retracts eight papers at once". According to the article, Journal of Biological Chemistry had questioned about some figures in those EIGHT papers, but the authors couldn't fix the issues. Specifically, it turned out that the original data used to generate the graphs was not availabe, which would mean that the papers are neither finalized nor published, and not reproducible as scientific research even if being published.

2. **After reading the paper by Sandve et al. describe which rule you are most likely to follow and why, and which rule you find the hardest to follow and will likely not follow in your future projects.**

All of the 10 recommendations sounds reasonabl. The most logical and easiest one for me seems to be the Rule 7: Always Store Raw Data behind Plots. The reason is that there is no reason not to keep the original data and code used to generate plots in my study, and I have been doing that since I almost always draw such plots by using languages for statistical computing and graphs such as R and SAS, so I store both the output and the code used for it without an extra effort. On the other hand, the most challenging rule would be the Rule 5: Record All Intermediate Results, When Possible in Standardized Formats. When necessary, I would record some intermediate ouputs in order to examine if my code is being developed well, but my storage capacity will be definitely insufficient in near future or my whole code looks unnecessarily messy if I save every intermediate result. If I face the situation where I need to fix my code, I would run the problematic part of the code, and look into the relevant output.
