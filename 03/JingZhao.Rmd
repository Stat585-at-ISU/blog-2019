Write a blog post addressing the questions: 

1. **Pick one of the papers Retraction Watch features on their website and describe what went wrong**. 

I read the paper retraction (Food packaging journal to retract paper by researchers in Thailand). The thing went wrong is that the reseracher tried to publish the same research in different journals. That senario is not particularly unusual; duplication, sometimes inaccurately called "self-plagiarism.

2. **After reading the paper by Sandve et al. describe which rule you are most likely to follow and why, and which rule you find the hardest to follow and will likely not follow in your future projects.**

Rule 2 and Rule 4 and rule 6 are most likely to follow.

1) It is also crucial for avingoid Manual Data Manipulation Steps. With the advancing in coding skill, we would rather use code for data manipulation than manual manipulation steps. This is also a good way to replication study.

2)We use R a lot and we learn to connect R studio to gitbub, it is very nature to save work to gitbub everytime and Github has the function of version control. Therefore, Rule 4 is most likely to follow.

3) Setting up seed is usually the rule to follow for simulation study. So, still will keep.

Rule 5 is the hardest to follow and will likely not follow in the further projects.
Rule 5 suggest us to Record All Intermediate Results, When Possible in Standardized Formats. This activity require a lot of work that are in general not useful for the current project. Time is usually the limited factor in doing a project, therefore, this rule is the hardest one to follow.
