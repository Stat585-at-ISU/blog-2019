1. **Pick one of the papers Retraction Watch features on their website and describe what went wrong**. 

The eight papers, which were co-authored by  Carlos López-Otín are retracts at once from the Journal of Biological Chemistry for figure issues. They were originally published between 2000 and 2007.

In one of the retracted paper, since the original data for an experiment performed 13 years ago and could not be found, the authors state that a new experiment was performed to validate the original experiment as well as support the result in the articles. For the rest of the paper, the JBC found the faults in specific panel. Althought the auther claimed that those mistakes did not affect the final results with providing the prove of the validation of the result and asked for a correction, but the JBC retain the retractions. The link to the post on Retraction Watch is the following <https://retractionwatch.com/2019/01/28/biochemist-in-spain-retracts-eight-papers-at-once/>.

2. **After reading the paper by Sandve et al. describe which rule you are most likely to follow and why, and which rule you find the hardest to follow and will likely not follow in your future projects.**

The rule I most likely to follow is Rule 2: Avoid Manual Data Manipulation Steps. My current research involve various varibles with geospatial and temporal components. manually maniqulate the data is not efficient. To make the analytical model run successfully over the research period, I would need to use programming language to work on the data, which increase the reproducibility of the work.

Rule 10 is the hardest to follow and might not follow: Provide Public Access to Scripts, Runs, and Results. My data is acquired from many different database. They would periodically update the data. Or they might retired the API access , which result the model nonfunctional.
