Write a blog post addressing the questions: 

1. **Pick one of the papers Retraction Watch features on their website and describe what went wrong**. 

The paper I want to talk about is “Production, characterization and controlled release studies of biodegradable polymer microcapsules incorporating neem seed oil by spray drying” written by Chiravoot Pechyen. The reason that the paper has been retracted is duplication. There are sections which overlap with some recently published papers and the duplicated part goes beyond normal scale. Although the two overlaped papers are owned by the same first author, the editor still retract that paper. "Self-plagiarism" is also not allowed in publications.



2. **After reading the paper by Sandve et al. describe which rule you are most likely to follow and why, and which rule you find the hardest to follow and will likely not follow in your future projects.**

I would like to follow rule 1, rule 2 and rule 4. For rule 1, I think it is very important because I want to know how every result was produced. So keeping track of it would remind me how to replicate my results. For rule 2, if we manually manipulate data, we may lose track of the way of manipulation. If so, we may not replicate the results. Rule 4 is a good way to track changes in our scripts. By using version controlled scripts, we don't need to worry about unwanted changes and can rollback to previous version. I think rule 3 is the hardest one because I seldom record the version of softwares or packages. I always keep them updated. If I run a script on an old version of software and then I update my software, I would probably not to rollback to old version just to replicate my results.
