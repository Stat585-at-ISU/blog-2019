## Background

Write a blog post addressing the questions: 

1. **Pick one of the papers Retraction Watch features on their website and describe what went wrong**. 
I pick the paper "An ontology-based method for assessing batch effect adjustment approaches" since there has one similar article with already published and use the similar approaches with different name to deal with batch effect.  
2. **After reading the paper by Sandve et al. describe which rule you are most likely to follow and why, and which rule you find the hardest to follow and will likely not follow in your future projects.**
(a) I like rule 1: I think it is important to  record every detail that may influence the execution of the step. Since I also use C, it is easy to create bugs and need to debug all the time. Some critical details include the name and version of the program, as well as the exact parameters and inputs that were used should be tracked and understand how it was produced.

(b)i also like Rule 4: I think this is important to rerun part of the process instead whole program because when we wirte code in R or C, many bugs may appear so it is feasible for us to check the bugs and make program more fluently.

(c)Rule 7: I will not follow rule 7 since in general, if one really wants to read fine values in a figure, we can make a notation in the plot or blow the plot rather than give him the raw numbers. Besides, ralely people want to find the exact numbers in plot but prefer visual the whole trend in plot.
