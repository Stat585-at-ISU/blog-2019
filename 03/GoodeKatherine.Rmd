## Question 1

**Pick one of the papers Retraction Watch features on their website and describe what went wrong**

I read through the article titled ["Former UMich postdoc earns five-year ban on Federal funding, after admitting to misconduct and then lying"](https://retractionwatch.com/2018/12/27/former-umich-postdoc-earns-five-year-ban-on-federal-funding-after-admitting-to-misconduct-and-then-lying/#more-82915). The Royal Society of Chemistry was contacted by the corresponding author of a paper about possible falsifications. The postdoc who was the first author on the paper admitted that he had falsified or fabricated data shown in several plots, and additionally, he was not able to locate the original data files. He told the investigators that there were no concerns with his other papers, but this was later found to be false. As a result, one of his papers has been retracted, and he has been banned from federal funding for five years.

## Question 2

**After reading the paper by Sandve et al. describe which rule you are most likely to follow and why, and which rule you find the hardest to follow and will likely not follow in your future projects.**

I think the easiest rule to follow for me would be rule 2 ("Avoid Manual Data Manipulation steps"). Since I always work in R for my research, following this step will naturally happen! The downside to working with R is that package versions are constantly changing. As a result, this will make rule 3 ("Archive the Exact Versions of All External Programs Used") difficult to follow. I can see the benefit of recording this information, but documenting all of the package versions seems like a tedious task. I often update R, RStudio, and packages in the middle of my work process (scary!), and this would mean that some of my older code could have been run with earlier versions than my newer code. I would have to document the versions used for each script/markdown document that I run. I do not currently do this, and I can see myself forgetting to do this in the future.
