1. **Pick one of the papers Retraction Watch features on their website and describe what went wrong.**
I picked and reviewed the article "Maternal Embryonic Leucine Zipper Kinase (MELK) Reduces Replication Stress in Glioblastoma Cells" by `J Biol Chem`. 2013 Aug 16; 288(33): 24200–24212, Published online 2013 Jul 8, published in the `Journal of Biological Chemistry`.\
This article was a biological and chemistry-base effort to offer an explanation for why elevated levels of the MELK protein are associated with growth of a particular kind of brain tumor, glioblastoma. Several clinical trials are investigating MELK inhibitors as cancer treatments. Since the results could  be used in brain tomur studies, it can highly impact the medical and pharmaceutical sciences and patients' cure. The problem, or better to say the mistake was manupulation of the data. There are a couple of inconsistencies in the article due to data manupulation. This manupulation was revealed in the final figure assembely because of randomly choosing some data. The authors did not use the primarily results on the data analysis and in order to reach the desired results, they did not apply those data into their final analysis. Later on, a recent paper published on March 2017 called all of their result into question whether their results were right because the recent papers suggested that inhibiting the MELK protein does not slow down certain types of cancer. The paper has been cited 20 times, according to Clarivate Analytics’ Web of Science. It was then retracted.


2. **After reading the paper by Sandve et al. describe which rule you are most likely to follow and why, and which rule you find the hardest to follow and will likely not follow in your future projects.**
What I really liked about the paper was rule 9, Connect Textual Statements to Underlying Results. It can be useful to keep track of textual interpretations connected to results of analyses. The textual interpretations usually are different while representation from text documents in the form of personal notes or correspondence between the collaborators of the research (where extra information about the document exists). Therefore, we need to be able to connect any textual statement such as interpretation or conclusion to the results of the statement. A helpful way to do so is connect statements to the results once the statements are initially formulated. There are useful tools for this purpose such as `Sweave` and `Galaxy Pages` and I tend to make them into work in the future research activities of mine.\
I also found rule 5, Record All Intermediate Results, When Possible in Standardized Formats a little bit challenging and probably hard to follow. Because, storing the intermediate results while generating main results sometimes seems unnecessary as we are aware of everything during research and every intermediate result seems to be trivial; however, months later we might not be as focused on the results as we can, so we may not remember details on achiving the results. This recording intermediate results is hard for me because I am usually concentrated on details during the resarch and  do not think of the future when I forget them.
