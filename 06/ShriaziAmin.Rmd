### Issues and discussion
I only added a new post to the blog after removing the existed materials on the blog. The post I added to my blog was related to our project for STAT 579 and concluded too many features and packages. Therefore, it took longer than I expected to get it on the website. The next problem was the file structure. It took me a while till I got I should get rid of extra lines in my r markdown file such as name of the authors and the introduction. The main confusion was that I wanted to directly put it into my website and forgot to change the structure of the file. There is still a lot for me to learn about blogdown because I like to use my website to host my professional projects and my interests.
