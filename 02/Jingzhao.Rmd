Write a blog post addressing the questions: 

1. **Which (base R) functions do you know that support the split-apply-combine strategy? In your opinion, are these sufficient - state why or why not?**. 

The base function support split-apply-combine includes apply(), sapply(), tapply(), aggregate().They are not sufficient when the data structure is complicated with multiple factors.

2. **Using a dataset of your choice, show (by including the split-apply-combine command(s) in your answer) how you can use the split-apply-combine strategy for a part of the data analysis.**

I choose the mtcars dataset as an example.

```{r}
data("mtcars")
library(tidyverse)
car<-mtcars %>% select(mpg,cyl,qsec) %>% group_by(cyl) %>% summarise(mpg=median(mpg),qsec=mean(qsec))
car
```
