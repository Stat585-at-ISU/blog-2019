Write a blog post addressing the questions: 

1. **Which (base R) functions do you know that support the split-apply-combine strategy? In your opinion, are these sufficient - state why or why not?**. 

"Aggregate" function is commonly used,but I personally think similar functions in tidyverse are much easier to work with. Maybe it is just for me, but I get too many error messages when using Aggregate, which means it is not that flexible. 

2. **Using a dataset of your choice, show (by including the split-apply-combine command(s) in your answer) how you can use the split-apply-combine strategy for a part of the data analysis.**

More efficient to creat summary statistics. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
iowa <- read.csv("http://www.hofroe.net/data/iowa-brfss-2012.csv")


iowa %>% filter(X_SMOKER3 == "Never Smoked") %>%
  group_by(X_AGE_G) %>% summarise(`# of respondents` = n(), `percentage (%)` = 100 * n() / 7015)
```
