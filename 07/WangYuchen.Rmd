1. According to R official website, R is licensed under GPL-2 | GPL-3 as a package.  

2. 
1)MIT: Users can use and share the code subject with the license freely, and users can “modify, merge, publish, sublicense, sell copies of the software without limitation” (see in carat).  Also, the authors or copyright holders are not responsible for any problems within the software. Thus, if we choose MIT license, we are fine with other people modifying our work, sharing the modify work (even with a more restrict license), making a profit. And if the package does not do what it suppose to do, none is responsible.  
2)GPL2: Users can copy, modify, and share the copies of the packges under the same license as the authors state in the description. Users can make a profit of the code but have to keep it under the same license (GPL2). And there is no warranty of the code. Thus, if we choose GPL2 license, we are fine with other people modifying our work, sharing the modify work with the same license as ours, or making a profit from our work if we state them in the description. If we want to be responsible for the software, we can state them in the description. Otherwise, we will state that we are not responsible for the software and no one is responsible.  
3)LGPL-3: this license is very like to GPL2, except that the package must include install Instructions while being copied and shared. we are fine with other people modifying our work, sharing the modify work with the same license as ours, or making a profit from our work if we state them in the description, and we can decide if we want to be responsible for the software.
4)CC-0:  Users can modify our work, share the modify work, and use our work for commercial purpose if we state them in the description. And we can state in the description if we want to be responsible for the software but we do not have to.

3. Assume our team is working on a new package for doing items matching. If we are modifying some packages under GPL2 or LGPL, then we have to put our work under the same license and contains the original code and copyright, and disclosure our code. If we are using some package under MIT, we can sublicense our work with a more restrictive liscense (like GPL or LGPL). Also, since no one is responsible for the packages under MIT, I might also state that I am not responsible for my package if I use anything under MIT. Thus, we are very possible to choose GPL or LGPL as the license of our work.
