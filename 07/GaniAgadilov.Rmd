Write a blog post addressing the following questions: 

1. **Under what license does R operate?**
  R operates under GPL-2 and GPL-3.

2. **Answer the three questions listed above for the licenses: MIT, GPL-3,  LGPL-3, and CC-0. Note that some of the questions might not be answered with a simple yes/no. In that case, go into more detail, but do not just copy the terms of the license.**

MIT
Under the MIT license, the authors allow to copy, modify, merge, publish the package and share it with others. In addition, anyone can make a profit from these codes. The authors are not responsible for any damage to the packages. 

GPL-3
In this license, everyone has a right to copy and distribute and change as long as changes have the original version of the license and source of stated changes. The package can be used for commercial purposes. If the work has some errors, the authors are not responsible for fixing software.

LGPL-3
Under this license, the main difference is changing is not allowed. However, the authors gave permission to distribute and copy the works. Users can make a profit by commercializing the provided packages/libraries. In addition, the authors did not give any warranty that the library/package works properly in all cases.

CC-0

In this license, everyone has a right to share, change and make a profit. There are fewer requirements in comparison with other types of licenses. If the work has some malfunctions, authors are not responsible for it.


3. **Assume that you are in the process of making a package for your own graduate work. Describe considerations that come into play in deciding on a license. In case you are not quite at that stage in your graduate studies yet, come up with a likely scenario. Describe it and discuss.**

If I have a task to create a new package that allows us to analyze and represent the data in a more appropriate way, I would use the GPL-3 license. In the early stage of developing work, interested users should have a chance to modify since approaches should not be restricted.  In addition, it allows to indicate and control an edited version of the packages when is needed.
