Write a blog post addressing the following questions: 

1. **Under what license does R operate?**

R is licensed under GPL-2 or GPL-3. And some header files are distributed under LGPL-2.1. When I checked my R studio, it is licesed on LGPL-2.1.
2. **Answer the three questions listed above for the licenses: MIT, GPL-3,  LGPL-3, and CC-0. Note that some of the questions might not be answered with a simple yes/no. In that case, go into more detail, but do not just copy the terms of the license.**

MIT: For this license, my collaborator and I are ok with other people to use and contribute the data and code, as long as they use the code come up with the license. It is fine for other users to use it to make a profit.  This licenses actually given user lots of permissions since it did not forbid the user to use to the code. No one should be responsible for it. 

GPL-3: It means other people can modify and edit the data and code, as long as the users have the source files and the license file come with the data and the code. It is also fine for other users to make a profit from those data and code. No one should responsible for it.

LGPL-3: It means that we are allowed for people to modify and distribute the code and data, but it should be under LGPL. Be specific, the modifications using LGPL3-licensed should be under LGPL3. It is also ok for the user to making a profit based on the modifying work. In this license, no one will be responsible for it.

CC-0: It means everyone can use it this package and can contribute it for any purpose. There are no restrictions on it. My collaborators and I are not the only authors who create and contribute the code and data. It is find for other people to get some profit from those changing since everyone can change it. No one can be responsible for it, since everyone can modify it. 

3. **Assume that you are in the process of making a package for your own graduate work. Describe considerations that come into play in deciding on a license. In case you are not quite at that stage in your graduate studies yet, come up with a likely scenario. Describe it and discuss.**

If I am working on my graduate work, I would like to use the license GPL-3 or LGPL-3. That is because I also want to know how successfully other people use and feedback about it. I would not be going to choose license CC-0 since everyone can modify it and something may be wrong.
