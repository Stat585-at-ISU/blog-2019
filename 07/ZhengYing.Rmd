3. **Assume that you are in the process of making a package for your own graduate work. Describe considerations that come into play in deciding on a license. In case you are not quite at that stage in your graduate studies yet, come up with a likely scenario. Describe it and discuss.**

    I will follow the corresponding licence of dependencies and references if I use functions from other packages. If all the work is developed by myself, I would like to set the GPL-3 license, by which, I can trace any modifications if someone else distribute and modify my work.
