### questions to be answered in question 2

   1. Are you and your collaborators fine with other people modifying your work and then sharing the modified work?             

   2. Are you and your collaborators fine with other people making a profit from those derivations?

   3. Who is responsible if your software does not do what it promises to do?



1. **Under what license does R operate?**

      + GNU GPL v2 , 3
       
      + Definition of GNU v2 from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License#Version_2):
       
      + "The GNU General Public License (GNU GPL or GPL) is a widely used free software license, which guarantees end users the freedom 
        to run, study, share and modify the software." 

2. **Answer the three questions listed above for the licenses: MIT, GPL-3,  LGPL-3, and CC-0. Note that some of the questions might not be answered with a simple yes/no. In that case, go into more detail, but do not just copy the terms of the license.**

   + MIT
           

     1. MIT allows freely copy, modify and distribute the code and software with only restriction that the license 
        must always be  distributed with the code.

     2. MIT allows others to make profit of the derivitative code.

     3. No one is responsible if the code doesn’t do what it expects to do.



    + GPL-3
    
      1.  allows others to distribute the code with just restriction to include the license, copyright information, 
           the tracked changes, and instruction to install.

      2. allows others to make profit of the derivitative code.for patent, they can charge the person use code if they wish.

      3. No one is responsible if the code doesn’t do what it expects to do.

                
     + LGPL-3
     
       1. allows copying and distributing while does not allow making changes.
       
       2. allows others to make profit of the derivitative code.
       
       3. authors are not responsible if the code doesn’t do what it expects to do.

               
      + CC-0
      
        1.  The license states that anyone can do anything with the original work.
            others can freely distribute the code , but they cannot trademark the derivations or use any patent claims.
        
        2. allows others to make profit of the derivitative code.

        3. authors are not responsible if the code doesn’t do what it expects to do.

   
         
    

3. **Assume that you are in the process of making a package for your own graduate work. Describe considerations that come into play in deciding on a license. In case you are not quite at that stage in your graduate studies yet, come up with a likely scenario. Describe it and discuss.**

    I would consider the following criteria for the licence that I will choose for my package:

        * Allow others to share, distribute and modify freely for educational purposes.

        * keep right for myself for commercial purposes.

        * allow people to modify it but not in a way to harm others.

        * I am not responsible for any failure or not working the product that promise to be.
    
   Therefore, GPL-3 may be a good choice for my future work.
