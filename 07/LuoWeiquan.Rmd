#### 1. Under what license does R operate?

  According to the [R project](https://www.r-project.org/Licenses/), R uses `GPL-2` or `GPL-3`
  
#### 2. Answer the three questions listed above for the licenses: MIT, GPL-3,  LGPL-3, and CC-0. Note that some of the questions might not be answered with a simple yes/no. In that case, go into more detail, but do not just copy the terms of the license.

  Three of the main questions to answer are: 

  Q1.Are you and your collaborators fine with other people modifying your work and then sharing the modified work?
  
  Q2.Are you and your collaborators fine with other people making a profit from those derivations?
  
  Q3.Who is responsible if your software does not do what it promises to do?

#### 3. Assume that you are in the process of making a package for your own graduate work. Describe considerations that come into play in deciding on a license. In case you are not quite at that stage in your graduate studies yet, come up with a likely scenario. Describe it and discuss.

Since I was working in Iowa State University, So All my publication within this project is ISU property, However, the package I create for the analysis in R, so I also need to make the source code avaliable according to GPL-3 or relative licenses.
