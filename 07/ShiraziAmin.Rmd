1. **Under what license does R operate?**
  R operates under license GPL-3.
  
2. **Answer the three questions listed above for the licenses: MIT, GPL-3,  LGPL-3, and CC-0. Note that some of the questions might not be answered with a simple yes/no. In that case, go into more detail, but do not just copy the terms of the license.**


  **MIT:**

  1. Others can do whatever they like with the codes on condition that the author's codes are also included with the license. 

  2. Others can make a profit out of the derivatives of your codes.
  
  3. In case your software does not work, not MIT nor anyone else is responsible. The authors are not liable in this case.


**GPL-3:**
  
  1. The GPL-3 license gives permission to other users to change your code as long as they keep the copyright, make the source codes and adjusments on the codes available..

  2. Others can make a profit out of the derivatives of your codes under GPL-3.
  

  3. Under GPL-3, in case your software does not work, not MIT nor anyone else is responsible. The authors are not liable.
  
  **LGPL-3:**
    
  1. It is mainly applied to libraries. Others may copy, distribute and adjust the software as long as the adjusments are documented for free under LGPL-3. That is, releasing source codes of the adjustments of the original codes only. 

  2. Others can make a profit out of the derivatives of your codes.

  3. WUnder LGPL-3, in case your software does not work, not MIT nor anyone else is responsible. The authors are not liable.
  
  **CC-0:**
  
  1. Under CC-0, others are can freely do anything to your codes for any puposes.

  2. Others can make a profit out of the derivatives of your codes under CC-0.

  3. WUnder CC-0, in case your software does not work, not MIT nor anyone else is responsible. The authors are not liable.
  
    
3. **Assume that you are in the process of making a package for your own graduate work. Describe considerations that come into play in deciding on a license. In case you are not quite at that stage in your graduate studies yet, come up with a likely scenario. Describe it and discuss.**

Actually, I am not quite at a stage in my studies to be thinking of making a package. But, if it comes to that, one important aspect I consider is if I have any plan to develop my work on the package later or not. In other words, if the package can play a good role in that area. Or, if my intention is only builing a package for a specific project, and not going through more details on expanding the package. In the first case, I would consider a restricted license like GPL-3 as my work matters a lot. In the second scenario, I would pick less restricted license so that ones who can make better use, can benefit more.
