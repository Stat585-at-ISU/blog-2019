1. **Under what license does R operate?**

- GNU General Public License


2. **Answer the three questions listed above for the licenses: MIT, GPL-3,  LGPL-3, and CC-0. Note that some of the questions might not be answered with a simple yes/no. In that case, go into more detail, but do not just copy the terms of the license.**

- MIT

    1. **Are you and your collaborators fine with other people modifying your work and then sharing the modified work?** Yes as long as the original license is distributed with the modified code

    2. **Are you and your collaborators fine with other people making a profit from those derivations?** Yes, commercial use is allowed.

    3. **Who is responsible if your software does not do what it promises to do?** No one is responsible by law.
    
- GPL-3

    1. **Are you and your collaborators fine with other people modifying your work and then sharing the modified work?** Yes, yet the requirements for distributing the whole work including a modification cannot be any greater than the requirements that are in the GPL.

    2. **Are you and your collaborators fine with other people making a profit from those derivations?** Yes (The licensee is allowed to charge a fee for this service, or do this free of charge.) 

    3. **Who is responsible if your software does not do what it promises to do?** No one is responsible by law.
    
- LGPL-3

    1. **Are you and your collaborators fine with other people modifying your work and then sharing the modified work?** Yes.

    2. **Are you and your collaborators fine with other people making a profit from those derivations?** Yes in the compliance with the requirement of the lisensee.

    3. **Who is responsible if your software does not do what it promises to do?** No one is responsible by law.
    
- CC-0

    1. **Are you and your collaborators fine with other people modifying your work and then sharing the modified work?** Yes.

    2. **Are you and your collaborators fine with other people making a profit from those derivations?** Yes.

    3. **Who is responsible if your software does not do what it promises to do?** No one is responsible by law.
    
    
3. **Assume that you are in the process of making a package for your own graduate work. Describe considerations that come into play in deciding on a license. In case you are not quite at that stage in your graduate studies yet, come up with a likely scenario. Describe it and discuss.** 

- I would consider GPL since I would like to keep the copyright about my graduate research for which I would have invested a lot of time and efforts. Even so, like the package ggplot2, it would be the most desirable for those who needs my work to use it as I could have the benefit from other's work. Also, that would be helpful for my work to be developed and maintained by being exposed to the public.
