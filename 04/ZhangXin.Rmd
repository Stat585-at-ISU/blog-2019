## Background:

Dates and times can be difficult to work with. Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5wpm-gesOY) to appreciate all of the fun scenarios that date/time libraries have to accommodate. 

Luckily, the `lubridate` package makes working with dates and times in R pretty straightforward. The package has been described in the paper [Working with date and time](http://www.jstatsoft.org/v40/i03/) by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham, an updated version of an intro to lubridate can be found in chapter 16 of [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/dates-and-times.html). Read one of the two sources.

Write a blog post addressing the questions:


- Describe what intervals, durations, periods, and instants are, and give one example for each that shows why we need these distinctions.

I will explain these definations with some example from the package 'Lubridata'.

```{r}
library(lubridate)
library(tidyverse)
```

- Instant is a specific moment in time line.

```{r}
is.instant(as.Date("2009-08-03"))
is.timepoint(5) 
```
- Interval is a time range, bounded by a stating time and ending time.

```{r}
diff <- make_difftime(days = 31) #difftime
as.interval(diff, ymd("2009-01-01"))
as.interval(diff, ymd("2009-02-01"))
```

- Duration is about the exact time (seconds) in a time span.

```{r}
span <- interval(ymd("2009-01-01"), ymd("2009-08-01")) #interval
as.duration(span)
```

- Period is a specified measurement unit for time, such as one year, one month etc.

```{r}
leap <- interval(ymd("2016-01-01"), ymd("2017-01-01"))
as.period(leap, unit = "days")
as.period(leap, unit = "years")
```

- The `ggplot2` package works seamlessy with lubridate. Find a data set with dates and/or times, use lubridate to work with the dates/times, then plot a time-related aspect of the data and describe it.
