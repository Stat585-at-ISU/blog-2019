## Background:

git and Github are tools for helping with versioning of files in collaborative efforts as well as archiving entries for your future self. 
Unfortunately working with git isn't always completely straightforward. 
Jenny Bryan's book "Happy git and github with R" helps with that. The book is available from [http://happygitwithr.com/](http://happygitwithr.com/). Have a look over the index and pick one of the chapters for a more in-depth read.

Write a blog post answering the following questions: 

1. **Looking back at all of the team projects you have been involved in, describe the biggest mishap you had. Could that have been avoided using git? How?**.   
  
When I did the final project with another two teammates for STAT 579 last semester, it was very difficult to merge our works together in R since we all use different variable names. It was very frustrating to change the variable names again and again, so that we could finalize our work. Now, with the help of Github, it is more convenient to share codes, or even writing code together.  
  
2. **Give an example of one new git feature that you learned about from Jenny Bryan's book.**.   
  
From chapter 9, I learned that you can clone a git repo not only from Github web or Desktop, but also by using command `git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY.git` in terminal. I have never been used to call command in terminal, but Github will bring me a lot more practice.
