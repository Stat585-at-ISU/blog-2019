#### Question 1: Looking back at all of the team projects you have been involved in, describe the biggest mishap you had. Could that have been avoided using git? How?

I have never had a huge mishap while working in a group, but there have been multiple instances when I was working in a group project for class when having used git would have been helpful. Before I knew about git, I would often use shared Google folders for group projects. Having a shared folder was helpful in the sense that we could access the work that other people were using. However, it made working with R difficult. We would all have our own scripts that we eventually had to combine into one document, or we would have to be in the same location working on the same document. Git would have allowed us to have one R markdown document that we could have accessed updates via git by pulling the updates to our own computers.

#### Question 2: Give an example of one new git feature that you learned about from Jenny Bryan's book.

I read Chapters 25 and 26 from Happy Git on dealing with push rejections, because I've never formally read about this. I usually just go through the prompts in RStudio, and eventually, everything seems to work out. However, I have been meaning to get read more about this anyway to better understand how to deal with conflicts, and I do not end up deleting my work or collaborator's work at some point. I learned about `git stash` and that it can be used to stash your uncommitted work while you pull the updates from git. I also learned about `pull --rebase`. The book says that it leads to a cleaner history in git. I did not realize that it is a goal to have a clean history. I understand the general idea of what a "clean history" is, but I am not sure that I understand the specifics. This seems like the next topic to learn more about.
