## Background:

git and Github are tools for helping with versioning of files in collaborative efforts as well as archiving entries for your future self. 
Unfortunately working with git isn't always completely straightforward. 
Jenny Bryan's book "Happy git and github with R" helps with that. The book is available from [http://happygitwithr.com/](http://happygitwithr.com/). Have a look over the index and pick one of the chapters for a more in-depth read.


1. The team project I had to do last semester was both group projects where we had to write a paper together. Google docs or Box have enabled this much easier compared to sending files back and forth through email. However, tracking down changes as to who is doing what sometimes becomes very hard to do. In such technical projects, collaborating from remote places becomes even harder then. Git should definitely help mitigate this problem as it creates a space for people to update their version of the documents separately without having to worry about having so many files saved differently everytime. It functions as sort of a gateway to allow or track down updates. 
2. Git allows different output format of R Markdown and render it to HTML for easy publishing in the website, especially it replaces the ugly look of HTML. Along with the push and pull features, it can make working collaboratively in R much smoother as well! It is important to be able to collaborate and understand each other's R codes, therefore the use of R Markdown, which then can great benefit greatly from using Github
